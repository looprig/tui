// collapseState is the modern viewport's thinking-fold state: a global default over
// every committed entry plus per-entry overrides of that default. Because the modern
// buffer re-renders from the committed transcript each frame, a change here is
// RETROACTIVE — an already-built entry re-folds to match the new state on the next
// frame (design §Collapse / expand). It is held BY VALUE inside the model, so its
// override map is cloned on write (mirroring transcriptModel.recordLoopLive/loopLive):
// a collapseState copied into a model copy never mutates the other's map.
type collapseState struct {
	// globalCollapsed is the fold applied to every entry with no override. It starts
	// TRUE — thinking renders folded by default (dense; expansion is reversible) — and
	// ToggleAll (ctrl+t) flips it authoritatively over the whole buffer.
	globalCollapsed bool
	// overrides is the per-entry override of globalCollapsed, keyed by the entry's
	// displayID; the value is "collapsed?" for that entry. An entry ABSENT from the map
	// follows globalCollapsed. Toggle sets one entry (cloning the map on write);
	// ToggleAll clears it, so the global toggle stays authoritative and retroactive.
