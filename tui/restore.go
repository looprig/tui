// property compares (displayed == stored == restored). It bundles the two pure reducer
// states (the scrollback transcript and the pending-gate interaction surface) so the
// restore-repaint path and the persistence property tests build the displayed view
// through one named seam. It is value-typed and immutable; FoldDisplay is its only

// events into a repaintable transcript: restoreBacklogCmd folds the restored backlog
// through it, and the persistence property tests fold both a restored ReplayBacklog and
// the original live Enduring sequence through it to assert the two displayed views are

// session it INSTALLS the rebuilt transcript + interaction wholesale (the state arrived
// pre-folded — no per-event work here) and flushes the committed backlog to scrollback
