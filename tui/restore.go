// DisplayProjection is the committed TUI projection of a fold over all delivered

// property compares (displayed == stored == restored). It bundles the two pure reducer
// states (the scrollback transcript and the pending-gate interaction surface) so the
// restore-repaint path and the persistence property tests build the displayed view
// through one named seam. It is value-typed and immutable; FoldDisplay is its only

// events into a repaintable transcript: restoreBacklogCmd folds the restored backlog
// through it, and the persistence property tests fold both a restored ReplayBacklog and
// the original live Enduring sequence through it to assert the two displayed views are

// state — IGNORING the live-only thinking DURATION. It is the headline-property comparator:
// a restored session's repainted transcript EqualTranscript the original session's live
// transcript iff the repaint reproduced the displayed view exactly. The interaction surface
// (its input editor carries cursor state and completion-panel closures that are not value-
// comparable) is intentionally NOT part of this equality — assert PendingPrompts for the
// pending-gate dimension instead.
//
// The thinking duration (entry.thinkDur and the live segment's streaming timestamps) is
// EXCLUDED from the comparison: it is measured from streaming TokenDelta timestamps, which
// are Ephemeral and NEVER journaled, so a cold-restore fold replays only the persisted
// StepDone events and legitimately produces dur == 0 (the restored row correctly shows
// "│ thought" with no number) while the same row folded live shows "│ thought for 10sec".
// That divergence is the ACCEPTED display behavior, not a repaint bug, so it is normalized
// out (normalizeThinkTiming) before DeepEqual; every OTHER field (the committed rows,
// ordering, blocks, tool cards, gate state) is compared exactly.
//
// This is a TEST / RESTORE-VERIFICATION comparator, NOT a cheap runtime equality check:
// normalizeThinkTiming allocates fresh copies of both models (committed slices + projection
// map/pointers) on every call, and reflect.DeepEqual walks the whole reducer state. Do NOT
