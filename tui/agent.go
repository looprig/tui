// EventStream is the narrow consumer-facing handle the TUI reads whole-session
// events from. It is event.Subscription — the read+teardown contract the session
// hub's *EventSubscription satisfies structurally — so the TUI depends on the
// interface, not the concrete hub type. Events yields the filtered fan-in stream;
// it closes on Close or on a hub-forced loss, after which Err reports the typed
// cause (nil for an intentional Close).

// Agent is the narrow surface the TUI drives. *coding.Coding satisfies it
// structurally; the TUI never imports any agent package.

	// Submit sends input fire-and-forget as a queueable UserInput; the returned
	// InputID correlates the Reply events (Cause.CommandID) that report the outcome.

	// Subscribe attaches a whole-session event consumer to the agent's session
	// fan-in with the given filter and returns its EventStream. It is the seam the
	// TUI uses to observe events across the entire session (every loop): a session
	// subscription spans turns and loops. The caller must Close the returned stream
	// when done. Use DefaultEventFilter for the single-loop TUI default.

	// ReplayBacklog returns the RESTORED session's historical Enduring events for a
	// cold-restore repaint, in session order. It is the backlog seam the TUI folds
	// off the update loop (restoreBacklogCmd) to rebuild the committed transcript +
	// pending gates BEFORE attaching the live Subscribe stream. The slice is
	// materialized (the data layer is sub-second for realistic sizes) so the consumer
	// drains it without owning a cursor's lifetime. A NEW (non-restored) session
	// returns nil/empty — the TUI then skips the repaint and behaves exactly as a
	// fresh session. A read failure returns a typed error the fold surfaces as a
	// non-fatal restore-error notice (history could not repaint; the live stream is
	// unaffected). The events are Enduring-only and from the primary loop's session
	// view — never the live 256-cap hub buffer. ctx bounds the read.

	// wrapper delegates to its session.

	// ProvideAnswer supplies the user's reply to a pending AskUser request
	// identified by callID. loopID names the gate-opening loop so the answer reaches

	// ExportSource returns a snapshot RecordSource over this session's full journal (events +
	// user commands) from the beginning, plus a live system-prompt resolver. The /export
	// action folds these through transcript.Reconstruct + html.Render into a self-contained
	// HTML file. Returns a *journalsource.ExportUnavailableError for a non-persisted
	// (in-memory) session, which the TUI errors.As to a friendly notice rather than an error.

// ToolCallStarted/Completed) from the PRIMARY loop only, and Enduring events
// (StepDone, gates, terminals) from EVERY loop. This is the spec's example filter —
// a TUI streams the primary loop's live progress (tokens AND tool spinners) while
// still seeing the finalized output of any subagent loop at StepDone granularity
// (those appear collapsed-but-present, attributed by Header.LoopID). Session-scoped
// events (SessionStarted/Active/Idle/Stopped) bypass the loop filter and always
// deliver.
//
// primaryLoopID names the loop whose live firehose the TUI wants; a subagent's
// tokens AND its tool-lifecycle chatter, excluded by the Ephemeral scope, never even
// enter the subscriber's egress buffer — by design amendment 1 the subagent's tools
// surface only via its Enduring StepDone, not a live per-call view.
