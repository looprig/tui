// EventStream is the narrow consumer-facing handle the TUI reads whole-session

// hub's *EventSubscription satisfies structurally — so the TUI depends on the

// it closes on Close or on a hub-forced loss, after which Err reports the typed
// cause (nil for an intentional Close).

	// pending gates BEFORE attaching the live Subscribe stream. The slice is
	// materialized (the data layer is sub-second for realistic sizes) so the consumer
	// drains it without owning a cursor's lifetime. A NEW (non-restored) session
	// returns nil/empty — the TUI then skips the repaint and behaves exactly as a
	// fresh session. A read failure returns a typed error the fold surfaces as a
	// non-fatal restore-error notice (history could not repaint; the live stream is
	// unaffected). The events are Enduring-only and from the primary loop's session

// AllLoopsEventFilter is the TUI's declared interest for a session subscription: BOTH

// (SessionStarted/Active/Idle/Stopped, ActiveLoopChanged) bypass the loop filter and always
// deliver.
//
// The TUI renders every loop's WHOLE live stream (a user can focus any subagent loop and
// watch its live tokens stream), so it must actually RECEIVE every loop's live Ephemeral
// firehose. (The widened scope also DELIVERS each loop's tool-lifecycle events; rendering
// them as live tool spinners inside a focused subagent projection is deferred — today a
// projection's live segment shows streamed text/thinking, and tool cards appear at StepDone.
// See routeProjection.) A primary-only Ephemeral scope would STARVE the per-loop projections
// of a subagent's live output, freezing a focused subagent view at Enduring StepDone
// granularity. The whole-session hub buffer is bounded and has no replay, so the TUI opens
// ONE all-loops subscription at startup and never re-subscribes; focus is then a pure view
// filter over already-received, already-projected state.
