// regression lock for the live→committed seam (design Option B):
//
//   - The running tool card paints live (spinner glyph appears in the stream) and is a
//     compact ONE-LINE indicator — the multi-line live card (header + result body) is
//     what used to be removed all at once on commit, fracturing the handoff.
//   - On ToolCallCompleted the live tail resolves the card in place; StepDone commits the
//     full card but FREEZES it in the surface (freeze-in-place), and it is emitted to
//     scrollback exactly ONCE at teardown (the ctrl+c freeze-flush) — no duplicate, and
//     the running-card body placeholder ("(no output)") never reaches scrollback.
//
// The test is deterministic: it hand-delivers each turn event as an eventMsg (the
// agent reader blocks, keeping the turn Running) and settles between sends so each
// frame paints. It is the same end-to-end harness shape as the resize-leak test.
