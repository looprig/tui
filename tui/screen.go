// Screen is the Elm model for the chat TUI. In scrollback-first mode it is a thin
// router over three pure helpers: transcript reconstructs the turn from the event
// stream and tracks committed entries + the live segment; scrollback prints each
// committed entry to native terminal scrollback exactly once; interaction owns the
// bottom surface (composer, slash panel, and the FIFO of pending permission/AskUser
// prompts). Screen holds only the agent wiring, the turn status, the ONE
// session-lifetime event subscription, the terminal dimensions, and the ctrl+t
// expand flag. There is no transcript viewport — the terminal owns history.
//
// Event transport: a SINGLE whole-session subscription (sub), established once at
// startup and read continuously by subNext, is the sole event source — it spans
// every turn and loop and never EOFs per turn. Submissions are fire-and-forget
// (submitCmd → agent.Submit); the LOOP owns queueing, so Screen keeps no queue.
// User rows are EVENT-DRIVEN: the authoritative user row commits from the loop's
// TurnStarted/TurnFoldedInto Message (genuine input only — Cause.LoopID == 0),
// never optimistically at submit; a successful submit only records the queued
// affordance (RecordSubmit), shown once InputQueued arrives. The loop's
// TurnStarted/TurnDone/TurnFailed/TurnInterrupted terminals on the subscription
// drive the turn status (for the PRIMARY loop only).

// CSI 13;2u, which v2 decodes to KeyEnter+ModShift. This ONLY helps on terminals that
// implement the Kitty keyboard protocol (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, foot, Alacritty,
// recent iTerm2 with the option enabled). On terminals WITHOUT it (Apple Terminal,
// many VS Code setups) Shift+Enter is indistinguishable from Enter no matter what we
// request — those rely on the Ctrl+J fallback (input.go). The request is inert on
// non-supporting terminals (they ignore the CSI), and it does NOT enable alt-screen,
// mouse capture, or focus reporting, so the scrollback-first invariant is preserved.
