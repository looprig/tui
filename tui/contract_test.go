// contract_test.go is the Task 11 regression-LOCK for the TUI side of the AskUser
// answer contract (design §2/§4 finding): with a with-choices prompt, the
// interactionModel must NEVER emit a uiAnswer whose Text is arbitrary typed text —
// it is ALWAYS a listed choice or the literal "other". If it ever did, that answer
// would fail tools.validateAnswer and surface as a tool-result ERROR string.
//
// validateAnswer is UNEXPORTED in package tools, so this tui-package test asserts
// the PUBLIC invariant directly — the produced uiAction.Text — rather than calling
// validateAnswer across the package boundary. The tools side of the same contract
// (the tool ACCEPTS those exact outputs) is locked in tools/askuser_test.go.

// choiceMembers reports whether text is a member of choices ∪ {otherChoice} — the
// exact set tools.validateAnswer accepts when choices is non-empty.

// TestContractChoiceAnswerAlwaysAMember is Guard A: for a with-choices prompt, NO

// uiAnswer at all, or (b) emits a uiAnswer.Text that validateAnswer would accept.
//
// The table drives one fresh choice prompt per key — letters/printables, digits in
// and out of range, the 'o' escape hatch, up/down navigation, and esc — and the
// loop asserts the invariant uniformly. Printable LETTERS in choice mode must NOT
// emit a uiAnswer (there is no free-text capture in choice mode); the test pins
