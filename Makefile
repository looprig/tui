# Module's own package dirs (go list ./... stops at nested module boundaries).

# gofmt recurses into directory operands, and for a module with a root package
# GO_DIRS contains the module root, so gofmt would walk the entire tree —
# including the nested .worktrees/ checkouts, which are separate modules. Use
# GO_FILES for gofmt: it expands to each package dir's own .go files (including
# platform-specific ones go list omits for the host) without descending.

# This module does not vendor. go.mod pins exact versions and go.sum verifies
# their content hashes, which is what makes a build reproducible; a vendor tree
# adds only offline builds and source-level dependency diffs. It also actively
# misleads: a stale vendor/ is ignored under a go.work but silently satisfies a
# GOWORK=off build, so standalone verification tests the vendored copy rather
# than the version go.mod actually pins — which is precisely what standalone
# verification exists to check.
