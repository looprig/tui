// JournalRecord is the sealed sum a session's serialized writer persists: an
// Enduring event, a command (the intent log), or an internal LeaseFence. It is a
// marker plus the one backend-neutral fact the writer needs to persist without
// re-inspecting the payload — the record's idempotency id (the stable per-record id
// a backend uses to de-duplicate a redelivered append). The concrete payload codec
// is the existing event/command marshaler; a record only carries the typed payload
// and exposes how to identify it. How a record is routed/stored is the backend's
// concern (a storekit ledger name, a subject, …), never the record's.
//
// The set is sealed by the unexported isJournalRecord marker: only the wrapper
// types in this package implement it, so the serializer's switch over the sum is
// exhaustive and a foreign type can never masquerade as a record.
