// JournalRecord is the sealed sum the serializer writes to a session's stream:
// an Enduring event, a command (the intent log), or an internal LeaseFence. It is
// a marker plus the two facts the writer needs to publish without re-inspecting
// the payload — the JetStream subject the record lands on and its idempotency id
// (the Nats-Msg-Id that de-duplicates a redelivered publish). The concrete
// payload codec is the existing event/command marshaler; a record only carries the
// typed payload and exposes how to route it.
//
// The set is sealed by the unexported isJournalRecord marker: only the wrapper
// types in this package implement it, so the serializer's switch over the sum is
// exhaustive and a foreign type can never masquerade as a record.
