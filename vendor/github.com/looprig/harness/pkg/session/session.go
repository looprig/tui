// GateHost is the capability to raise a HOST-OWNED gate: to put a structured
// question or an out-of-band action to a human and receive the answer directly.
//
// It is a SEPARATE contract rather than three more methods on SessionController,
// for two independent reasons.
//
// The first is segregation. Opening a gate is not part of running a session:
// almost every consumer of a SessionController — the TUI, the CLI, a test —
// submits work, watches events, and answers gates, and none of them raise one.
// Widening SessionController would force every implementation to grow three
// methods that only an integration host calls, which is the exact coupling the
// interface rules forbid.
//
// The second is that the two contracts have different holders. A SessionController
// is the session's operator. A GateHost is whatever opened a particular gate and
// is blocked on its answer — an MCP binding servicing an elicitation, say. Those
// are the two ends of the same gate, and RespondGate (on Session) is the other
// end: a client answers, the host receives. Keeping them separate keeps that
// asymmetry visible instead of collapsing both roles into one god-interface.
//
// A live session implements it, so a host obtains one by asserting on the
// controller rig returns:
//
//	host, ok := controller.(session.GateHost)
//
// The contract is host-owned gates ONLY (gate.KindForm and gate.KindOpenURL with
// gate.ResolverSession). There is deliberately no way to open a permission or
// ask-user gate through it: those are answered by resuming a parked loop, and a
// host that could mint one could park — or forge an approval against — a loop
// that is not its own. An implementation MUST refuse anything else at open time
// rather than at answer time, so a caller learns its request was invalid before a
// human is shown a prompt that can never be delivered.
type GateHost interface {
	// OpenHostGate opens g and returns its id. The gate is public and answerable
	// when it returns. The caller MUST then either AwaitGateAnswer or CloseGate;
	// abandoning it without either leaks the answer slot for the session's life.
	OpenHostGate(context.Context, uuid.UUID, gate.Gate, gate.Payload) (gate.ID, error)
	// AwaitGateAnswer blocks until the gate is answered and returns the validated
	// answer, including the form values that are absent from every durable record.
	// An answer is delivered exactly once. Cancelling the context abandons the
	// wait and frees the slot but does NOT close the gate — the gate is durable
	// state and the context is the caller's, so an opener that gives up must
	// CloseGate.
	AwaitGateAnswer(context.Context, gate.ID) (gate.Answer, error)
	// CloseGate withdraws a gate without answering it, waking any awaiter with a
	// *GateError{GateNotFound}. It is how an opener cleans up after a cancelled or
	// timed-out request.
