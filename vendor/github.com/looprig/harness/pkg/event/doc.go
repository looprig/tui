// Package event defines the sealed union of rig, session, loop, turn, step, and
// tool events. Enduring rig-control and workspace transitions are durable replay
// inputs; ephemeral streaming events are never persisted.
//
// Every concrete event embeds a Header (producer identity), exactly one lifecycle
// mixin (ephemeral, enduring, or terminal — supplying Class()/EndsTurn()), and
// exactly one scope mixin (sessionScoped or loopScoped — supplying Scope()). The
// compile-time assertions below pin the sealed union: every concrete event type
// must satisfy Event, and the list is the authoritative enumeration of the union.
// Adding a new event without adding it here is harmless, but removing a type or
// breaking its interface satisfaction fails the build here first.
package event

// Sealed-union interface-satisfaction assertions. Each concrete event must
// satisfy Event (isEvent + Class + Scope + EndsTurn + EventHeader). The intended
// "exactly one lifecycle mixin and exactly one scope mixin" is enforced from both
// sides: embedding two of a kind makes the promoted selector ambiguous (won't
// compile), and embedding zero leaves the method missing (won't satisfy Event) —
// so any count other than one fails these assertions.
