// Package tool defines the dependency-free contract surface for the tools
// subsystem: the BaseTool/InvokableTool interfaces every tool implements, the
// ToolResult value tools return, the tool-owned preparation boundary
// (CallPreparer, Request, Requirement, RuleCandidate — see preparation.go), and
// the optional capability interfaces the runner probes for via type assertion.
// It imports only core packages (plus stdlib); it must never import pkg/loop,
// the runtime internals, or a concrete tools module, so all of them can depend
// on it without a cycle.
//
// Ownership: tools own preparation — decoding untrusted arguments, normalizing
// commands/URLs/paths, resolving canonical resource identities — and produce
// the typed prepared Request. The three-state Deny/Gated/Allow decision, the
// single combined approval, and response routing belong to pkg/gate; sandbox
// profiles and OS enforcement belong to the enforcing consumer behind
// structural seams; durable rule persistence is consumer-provided.
