// gcGraceWindow is the minimum age an UNREFERENCED object must reach before GC may
// reap it. It exists to protect an object whose offload upload has landed but whose
// pointer append is still in flight (upload-before-append: the object is durable
// BEFORE any pointer references it, so for a window there is a live object with no
// pointer yet). It MUST exceed the longest possible upload->pointer-append gap.
//
// That gap is bounded by the write path's three serial deadlines on a single Append:
//   - defaultAppendTimeout (5s): the per-append publish round-trip deadline.
//   - the ambiguous-ack resolve retry: a second publish, again bounded by
//     defaultAppendTimeout (5s) — so up to ~10s of publishing for one record.
//   - dedupWindow (2m): a lost-ack republish under the same Nats-Msg-Id dedups
//     against the already-committed record only within this window; an append whose
//     ack was lost may be re-driven (and thus reference its uploaded object) as late
//     as the dedup window's end.
//
// The dedup window (2m) dominates. The grace window is set to a generous multiple of
// the dominant term plus the publish budget so a just-uploaded object whose pointer
// is still being committed is NEVER reaped: an object younger than this is left alone
// even if no pointer references it yet. Content addressing makes GC idempotent, so
// erring long here only delays reclaiming a true orphan — it never risks deleting a
// live one.
