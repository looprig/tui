// sessionCore is the SHARED transport both TUI presentation shells embed: the
// scrollback-first Screen and the modern viewport Screen. It owns everything an
// event router must own — the agent wiring, the ONE session-lifetime subscription and
// its lifecycle (stale/nil guards), the dispatch of each event into the transcript,
// interaction, and compaction reducers, the active-loop turn status, the /clear ordering, and
// the submit/interrupt/gate command wiring — but NO presentation. Extracting it means
// event routing cannot drift between the two modes: a new event type handled here is
// handled by both shells at once.
//
// Event transport: a SINGLE whole-session subscription (sub), established once at
// startup and read continuously by subNext, is the sole event source — it spans every
// turn and loop and never EOFs per turn. Submissions are fire-and-forget (submitCmd →
// agent.Submit); the LOOP owns queueing, so the core keeps no queue. User rows are
// EVENT-DRIVEN (committed by the transcript reducer from the loop's TurnStarted/
// TurnFoldedInto Message), never optimistically at submit. EVERY loop's turn events fold a
// per-loop running bit, but the displayed turn status follows only the ACTIVE loop's bit —
// the session's active loop, whose baseline is read at subscribe and advanced by each
// ActiveLoopChanged; a background loop's turn events fold silently.
//
// Presentation stays in the embedding shell: the core's methods MUTATE the shared
// transport state and return the TRANSPORT command (re-arm, submit, reopen, …) plus,
// for the paths that commit an out-of-band entry, a boolean signal telling the shell to
// present it (scrollback flush for Screen, viewport re-render for Screen). The
// core never touches scrollback, held tails, animation, or a viewport.
