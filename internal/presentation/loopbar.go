// independent privileged loop ids the visible cap always keeps — focused is the loop the
// viewport renders, active is the session's current default target (a selection event advances
// it without moving focus). max is the visible cap: at most max entries render, the rest fold
// into a "… +N" overflow marker so the bar never grows unbounded. A max <= 0 means no count cap. The two
